# Polyorbit
Make planets, make moons, set distance to set orbit, when moons or planets pass the middle line, they play a sound. Polyrhythm 

Clone anywhere or download the polyorbit folder, or, just download demoini.py and generaterandom.py and put them in a folder somewhere.

1. pip install pygame pyo
2. Run generaterandom.py
3. Edit the settings file if you want.
4. Run demoini.py

generaterandombeta has some more features, and for now is locked to CMajor for frequencies to produce some better sounding overall sound with lots of moons and planets. 

I plan on forcing in a scale selection option soon so it can also only pull from certain scales for sounds. Interesting stuff.
